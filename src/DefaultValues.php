$page_description = "My name is Samantha Murphey. I'm a 23 year old trans-lesbian hacker-girl living in LA. I have a passion for merging art and code and so I spend most of my time building web-apps and producing music. There's quite a lot of material on this site to see / hear / play with, so I suggest choosing one of the categories below or to the left to start off with. Or if you think you can brave the chaos, scroll down a bit further for a full reverse-chronological view of ALL my work.";
